# hoi4-update-csv-script

## About
This script takes terrain.bmp, provinces.bmp and definition.csv files. It outputs output.csv, an updated csv based on definition.csv with updated terrain information based on color-coding found in terrain.bmp.

Not sure if this will be useful to anyone at all-- I don't know much about HOI4, let alone HOI4 modding, and made this for a friend upon request.

## How to use
Place the Python script in the same folder as terrain.bmp, provinces.bmp and definition.csv. Try to run it-- if it doesn't work immediately, you may be missing dependencies. You can install any missing dependencies using the ```pip``` command. Look for the output.csv, and that is your new, updated csv with current terrain information.
