# hoi4-update-csv-script
Script to help in making HOI4 mods

This script takes terrain.bmp, provinces.bmp and definition.csv files. It outputs output.csv, an updated csv based on definition.csv with updated terrain information based on color-coding found in terrain.bmp.

Not sure if this will be useful to anyone at all-- I don't know much about HOI4, let alone HOI4 modding, and made this for a friend upon request.
